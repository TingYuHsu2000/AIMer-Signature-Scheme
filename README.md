# AIMer-Signature-Scheme

### Overview

This repository contains research presentations related to the AIMer signature scheme, a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signature scheme proposed by Seongkwang Kim. The AIMer scheme leverages zero-knowledge proofs(ZKP) and secure multiparty computation(MPC) techniques to achieve quantum-resistant digital signatures.
